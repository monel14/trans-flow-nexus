# Test Report: Authentication and ProofViewer

## Summary

Testing was conducted on the authentication system and ProofViewer component. The tests revealed several issues that need to be addressed.

## 1. Authentication Testing

### Test Results:

- ✅ **Demo Account Generation**: Successfully created all demo accounts (admin, sous-admin, chef d'agence, agent, developer)
- ❌ **Login Functionality**: Failed to log in with any account due to database schema issues
- ❌ **Role-based Access Control**: Could not test due to login failure

### Issues Identified:

1. **Database Schema Error**: 
   ```
   Error fetching profile: {code: PGRST200, details: Searched for a foreign key relationship between 'profiles' and 'user_roles' in the schema 'public', but no matches were found., hint: Perhaps you meant 'roles' instead of 'user_roles'., message: Could not find a relationship between 'profiles' and 'user_roles' in the schema cache}
   ```

   The `AuthContext.tsx` is trying to query the `user_roles` table with a relationship to `profiles`, but this relationship doesn't exist in the database schema.

2. **Transaction Ledger Error**:
   ```
   Erreur lors de la création de l'entrée ledger: {code: 23514, details: null, hint: null, message: new row for relation "transaction_ledger" violates constraint "transaction_ledger_transaction_type_check"}
   ```

   This error occurs during account creation, but doesn't prevent the accounts from being created.

## 2. ProofViewer Testing

Could not test the ProofViewer component due to authentication issues. The following tests were planned but not executed:

- Display of "Preuve" column in transaction table
- ProofViewer modal functionality
- Handling of different file types (images, PDFs)
- Zoom and rotation functionality

## Recommendations

1. **Fix Database Schema**:
   - Ensure the relationship between `profiles` and `user_roles` tables is properly defined
   - Alternatively, modify the `AuthContext.tsx` to use a different query that doesn't rely on this relationship

2. **Update AuthContext.tsx**:
   - The current implementation in `AuthContext.tsx` tries to fetch user roles using a relationship that doesn't exist
   - Consider modifying lines 56-66 to use a direct query instead of a relationship query:
   ```typescript
   const { data: profile, error: profileError } = await supabase
     .from('profiles')
     .select('*')
     .eq('id', userId)
     .single();

   // Then fetch roles separately
   const { data: userRoles } = await supabase
     .from('user_roles')
     .select('roles (name, label)')
     .eq('user_id', userId)
     .eq('is_active', true);
   ```

3. **Fix Transaction Ledger Constraint**:
   - Investigate and fix the constraint violation in the `transaction_ledger` table

## Conclusion

The authentication system is not functioning correctly due to database schema issues. This prevents testing of the ProofViewer component. The issues appear to be related to database relationships rather than the frontend code itself.

Once the authentication issues are resolved, further testing of the ProofViewer component can be conducted to verify its functionality.
