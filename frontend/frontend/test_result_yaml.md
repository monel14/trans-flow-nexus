    message: "I've tested the Supabase connection and authentication. The basic connection to Supabase is working, but authentication and database access are failing. There appears to be an issue with the Row Level Security (RLS) policies in the Supabase database, causing 'infinite recursion detected in policy for relation profiles' errors. This needs to be fixed before further testing can be done."
  - agent: "testing"
    message: "The main issue appears to be with the RLS policies in the Supabase database. This is preventing access to all tables, even with the correct API key. The policy for the 'profiles' table seems to be causing an infinite recursion, which is a common issue when policies reference themselves or create circular dependencies."
